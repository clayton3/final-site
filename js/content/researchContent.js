            <h4>Subcultural Identity in Alternative Music Culture</h4>
            <p>
                When looking at how subcultures intertwine with how music is so closely tied with identity it becomes very apparent that there is a very clear
                correlation between a subculture and the music that many of the people that belong to that particular subculture. In Holly Kruse's
                 <i> Subcultural Identity in Alternative Music Culture</i>, the text discusses how music is tied to identity by discussing how it
                allows people to identify with a particular subculture. This is a positive aspect of music because it allows people to express
                their individuality and to feel part of a community. This can be seen in Kruse's text in examples such as "So college music is not just about
                college radio, but with particular geographic sites: the most famous scene was Athens, Georgia from the late 1970s through the mid-1980s, home of
                the B-52's, REM, Love Tractor and, temporarily, Matthew Sweet; more recently prominent in Seattle, home of Nirvana, Pearl Jam, Soundgarden, and
                Mudhoney" (Kruse 33). Kruse is able to display through this excerpt that the music that is listened to is not just about what is fed to a particular
                group, it is what the group identifies with.

            <h4>A woman's voice: The politics of gender identity in music therapy and everyday life</h4>
            <p>
                Besides just looking at how the music that we listen to relates to identity, it is also very important to try and look at how performative music
                can relate to someones identity. There are many ways that these tie together but in the case of Randi Rolvsjord's <i>A woman's voice:
                The politics of gender identity in music therapy and everyday life</i> they show how identity relates through gender identity. This text is
                discussing how the voice is tied to identity in a good way. It shows how the voice can be used to create and understand different traits,
                preferences, and behaviours. It also demonstrates how the voice is implicated in the "production of the body", the person and their identity.
                Rolvsjord's text is important because it offers new ways of thinking about how music and identity intersect. It opens up new avenues of exploration,
                and provides a fresh perspective on a topic that is essential to understanding the human experience. As Randi Rolvsjord said, "So rather than only thinking about male and
                female voices in terms of physical production in the body, it is vital to consider how the voice is implicated in the 'production of the body',
                the person and their identity, as the voice holds implications 'for the body', specifically in terms of sex and gender" (Rolvsjord). This excerpt
                speaks to how the voice in particular correlates with identity in music to so many people and how it is important for people to try to understand
                how that affects those making and experiencing the music.

            <h4>National Identity in Music</h4>
            <p>
                The last form of how music is inherently tied to identity is through national identity. To support this argument, <i>National Identity in Music </i>
                by Kevin Brown is a particularly good example. Brown mentions a song, <i>Yankee Doodle</i>, that has a long history that is tied to American
                identity. It was originally sung by British troops to make fun of Americans, but eventually the Americans claimed the song and began singing it as a
                way to mock the British. The song eventually became a something that American's owned and took as a sort of pride, in Brown's text this is illustrated well (Brown).
                This quote from Brown's text is particularly interesting due to how it shows that Americans incorporated a song written to mock them as part of
                their identity and embraced it in a form of rebellion.
