            <h2>Interviews about Identity</h2>

            <h4>Setup</h4>
            <p>
                When looking to try and show the correlation between music and identity I knew immediately that
                I could not just rely on the research of others. In order to show this relationship I decided to
                conduct interviews with several people to try and see if there are any factors that show any
                particular ties between the types of music that people listen to and how much that music ties in
                with their identity. To accomplish this I asked eight questions:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>How long have you been into music?</li>
                <li>How does your taste in music relate to your identity?</li>
                <li>Where did you grow up?</li>
                <li>Do the people around you listen to the same music as you?</li>
                <li>What are some of your hobbies?</li>
                <li>How has your taste in music changed as you have aged?</li>
                <li>Do you think that your taste in music defines you?</li>
                <li>How often do you listen to music?</li>
            </ol>

            <h4>Interview #1</h4>
            <img style={{width: "25%", borderRadius: "2rem", border: "solid"}} src={"pics/rock.png"}/>
            <p>
                The first interview that I conducted was with a friend of mine that listens to a lot of
                rock music and attends Temple. These were their answers:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>I've been into music for as long as I can remember. It's always been a big part of my life.</li>
                <li>My taste in music is a big part of my identity. It's how I express myself and connect with others.</li>
                <li>I grew up in a small town in the middle of nowhere. Everyone around me listened to country music, but I was into rock.</li>
                <li>No, the people around me don't usually listen to the same music as me. I have a few friends who are into rock, but most people I know don't really understand it.</li>
                <li>I like to play guitar, and I'm really into cars.</li>
                <li>My taste in music has changed a lot as I've gotten older. I've become more open-minded and I've discovered new genres that I never would have thought to listen to before.</li>
                <li>Yes, I think my taste in music defines me. It's a big part of who I am.</li>
                <li>I listen to music all the time. It's always on in the background, and I usually have my headphones with me so I can listen whenever I want.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                Based on this, their answers describe how music is a big part of their identity. They express
                themselves through their taste in music, and it is how they connect with others. They grew up
                in a small town where everyone listened to country music, but they were
                into rock. This made it difficult for them to connect with people because most people
                around them didn't understand their taste in music. However, they have become more
                open-minded as they've gotten older and has discovered new genres of music that they
                never would have thought to listen to before. Music is a very important part of who they are,
                and it is something that they listen to all the time. After analyzing my friends answers to these
                questions I saw a very clear correlation about how they have really identified with the type of music
                they listen to over the years in many facets of their life. After seeing this I was very excited to go
                into the next interview!

            <h4>Interview #2</h4>
            <img style={{width: "25%", borderRadius: "2rem", border: "solid"}} src={"pics/alt_rap.png"} />
            <p>
                My second interview that I conducted was with another friend of mine that listens to alternative rap and also attends Temple. These were their answers:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>I've been into music since I was a kid.</li>
                <li>My taste in music relates to my identity because it's something I'm passionate about.</li>
                <li>I grew up in a small town.</li>
                <li>The people around me don't usually listen to the same music as me.</li>
                <li>Some of my hobbies are playing video games, hanging out with friends, and listening to music.</li>
                <li>My taste in music has changed as I've aged because I've become more open-minded to different genres and artists.</li>
                <li>I don't think my taste in music defines me, but it is a big part of who I am.</li>
                <li>I listen to music every day.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                After hearing this person's answers I was a little surprised. I expected more differences in answers from my first interview based on the difference
                in the type of music. However, I found that their answers were in a very similar vein. They have been into music since they were a kid, and it is
                something they are passionate about. Their taste in music relates to their identity because it is something that they are interested in and
                have grown up with. Even though they have changed their taste in music over time, it is still a big part of who they are. I think that these answers in
                retrospect make a lot of sense based on the person's upbringing and experiences. I found it really interesting to hear from them about how they relate with
                their identity.

            <h4>Interview #3</h4>
            <img style={{width: "25%", borderRadius: "2rem", border: "solid"}} src={"pics/country.png"} />
            <p>
                In the last interview that I conducted I decided to interview someone on campus that I knew that had transferred from the south. They mainly listen to
                country music and I felt this would provide a nice contrast compared to my other interviews. These were their answers:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>I've been into music since I was a kid. I grew up listening to country music with my family. I've always loved listening to music, and it's a big part of my life.</li>
                <li>My taste in music relates to my identity because it's a big part of who I am. I grew up in the South, and country music is a big part of the culture there. I think it's important to listen to music that reflects your culture and who you are.</li>
                <li>I grew up in the South. Country music has always been a big part of my life. I think it's important to listen to music that reflects your culture and who you are.</li>
                <li>Most of the people around me listen to the same music as me. I think it's important to listen to music that reflects your culture and who you are.</li>
                <li>Some of my hobbies include listening to music, going to concerts, and spending time with my friends and family.</li>
                <li>My taste in music has changed as I have aged. I've become more open-minded and I'm always looking for new music to listen to. I think it's important to keep your mind open to new things.</li>
                <li>I don't think that my taste in music defines me. I think it's just a part of who I am. I'm more than just my taste in music.</li>
                <li>I listen to music every day. It's a big part of my life. I think it's important to listen to music that reflects your culture and who you are.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>
                After hearing the answers from my third and final interview I found it was interesting to see the differences when the person had come from a background
                where their preferred music was more often listened to. What they had to say relates to identity in music because it is a big part of the person's
                life. They grew up listening to country music, which is reflective of their culture. They think it is important to listen to music that is
                reflective of who they are. I think that seeing how they felt about their taste in music being tied to their culture was really interesting because it
                made me think about my research into national identity in music, which can be seen in the research section of this website. I think that this interview really
                made this dataset feel much more complete.
            </p>

            <h4>Conclusions</h4>
            <p>
                I feel like I really learned a lot from these experiences interviewing the people around me about their taste in music and how they felt it tied to their
                identity. There are a lot of ways that they thought about my questions I really had not considered which was surprising. This experience has really made me think
                about my original argument in a more complex way and I am glad to have learned so much from this experience.
