            <h2>The Musical Styling of Spencer LaJoye:</h2>
            <p>
                Spencer LaJoye's music is characterized by their use of both folk and pop music styles. By blending these genres, Spencer is able to communicate deep
                concepts and meaningful lyrics through their songs. The use of folk and pop music makes Spencer's music easy for anyone to listen to, while still providing
                the listener with a desired message. Spencer's use of rhythm and looping creates unique effects in their music, without being limited by the number of
                people performing.
