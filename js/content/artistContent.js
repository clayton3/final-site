            <h2>Information about Spencer LaJoye:</h2>
            <p>
                Spencer LaJoye is a queer, trans, singer-songwriter from Boston, MA. They are a classically trained violinist and use looping pedals to create their unique sound.
                Their music is a mix of folk, pop, and indie and they write both personal and autobiographical lyrics. They have won several awards, including the WYCE Jammie Award for
                Listener's Choice and the Kerrville New Folk Songwriting Competition. They have also been chosen as an official showcase artist at Folk Alliance Region Midwest.
                In their live performance they are able to create a very intimate and inviting atmosphere. Spencer's upbringing is weaved very well into their music through
                their use of lyricism and mixing the techniques they learned in their evangelist upbringing. Spencer is able to seamlessly weave their storytelling skills into their
                songs during live performance, many times starting a story and transitioning to song at just the right time to make you feel the music just that much more.
