            <p>
                Spencer LaJoye's live show drove me to think a lot about what I desired to get from the live performances I experience in the future. Historically,
                I have gone to performances with a higher energy, at larger events. However, after seeing Spencer's live performance and absorbing the atmosphere that
                was created for their performance, I found that it was a soothing and enjoyable experience having the opportunity to be able to experience someone's music
                in such an intimate setting. Something else I found that made me feel significantly more settled was when the owner of the house's dog, Beans, came and
                laid down on my lap during the performance. That moment in particular enhanced the experience quite a bit for me. I did not go into the performance with
                any particular expectations.
