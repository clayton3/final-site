            <h2>Personal Reflection on Music and Identity</h2>
            <p>
                There are few things in life that have the ability to touch our souls the way music does. It has the power to evoke long-forgotten memories,
                to bring us back to a time and place we once called home. For me, music has always been a huge part of my identity. It has served as a source of
                comfort during difficult times, a way to express myself when words failed me, and a way to connect with others who have shared similar experiences.
                During my time in college, music has played an even more important role in my life. As I've navigated my way through the ups and downs of university
                life, music has been there to provide a sense of stability and familiarity. It has been a constant reminder that no matter how challenging things
                might get, there is always something to sing and dance about. Music has also served as a way for me to connect with others on a deeper level. In
                a world where it can be so easy to feel alone, music has provided me with a sense of community. Through shared musical experiences, I have been
                able to connect with others in a way that goes beyond words. I am grateful for the role music has played in my life, and I know that it will
                continue to be a source of strength and comfort as I move forward throughout the rest of my life. Personally I feel that the evolution I have had
                in terms of the music I listen to has changed quite a bit over the course of my life. When I was younger I would just listen to whatever was on the
                radio stations my parents listened to. After that it moved more to what I found on my own through the internet, but it was still very attached to
                things my parents had exposed me to. Over more and more time thought I was really able to find my own tastes in music, while I still can certainly
                trace my music tastes to the old songs from the 70s my dad would play in the car, I have had my own journey with music and I am very proud of all the
                experiences I have had because of it.
