            <h2>Social Issues in Spencer's Works:</h2>
            <p>
                Spencer LaJoye is a musician who is gender non-binary, and their music discusses the social issue of coming out as transgender or
                gender non-binary. Spencer's goal is to foster a life-affirming community through music, and to "bring people to church" at their shows.
                When looking further into how this is discussed within Spencer's sphere of influence it becomes evident that not only does Spencer tackle
                the issues of coming out as transgender or gender non-binary, Spencer talks a lot about finding one's self in general no matter what issues you may be
                facing. Spencer and those within their influence are able to bring each other and the people around them a sense of belonging that is rarely seen in today's
                world.
