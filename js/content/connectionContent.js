                When thinking about my experience with Spencer LaJoye's performance I immediately think about when we were assigned to read Simon Frith's
                thoughts on identity in music. Frith's ideas on music and identity I felt were particularly relevant in the case of Spencer LaJoye's music. Spencer's
                style of music is very much so rooted in their upbringing as part of an evangelist community. When one's musical styling is so intertwined with the faith
                that they were brought up in, it makes sense that it would also be intertwined in their identity. To go further than just the music of their upbringing,
                Spencer also mixes a lot of their experiences finding themselves into their music which in my opinion further ties the music to their identity.
