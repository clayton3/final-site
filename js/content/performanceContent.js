          <h2>What the Performance was like:</h2>
          <p>
              During Spencer LaJoye's live performance in South Philadelphia, the atmosphere was very comfortable and inviting. The venue was the home of a relative
              of Spencer and their partner. Before the concert, there were drinks and other options for everyone to gather around and socialize to get to know each other
              and therefore make a more comfortable atmosphere. After the pre-show socialization was over, Spencer led us to a room that allowed the audience to sit around
              Spencer's setup to watch them perform their set. Spencer's set-list was able to captivate the audience through their elaborate and skillful use of both their
              technical abilities as well as their lyricism. It was also impressive that Spencer was able to do all of this while still interacting with the audience and getting
              them to sing along at times and asking questions to the audience to further immerse them in the experience.
