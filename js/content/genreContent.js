            <h2>What is Folk Music:</h2>
            <p>
                Folk music is a genre that can vary greatly in terms of what it represents and how it sounds depending
                on the artist you listen to. It originates from the German word "volk", which is a rather fitting term
                as it translates to "the people" and folk is truly the music of the people. This genre is one that has
                been around forever but as of today it is not the most popular, yet it still has a dedicated audience
                of people who love to hear stories told through music. Many would argue that when someone tells their
                story through music that it allows power to be carried through it. The kind of folk that people are
                more familiar with today came about in the mid-20th century and is more commonly known as contemporary
                folk music. Folk music can also be viewed as like folk tales which were traditionally stories told
                orally. So looking at the similarities between folktales and folk music it is obvious that they both
                have storytelling in common and when looking at the root in “volk” both folktales and folk music can
                be seen as stories of the people being told, folk music is simply an evolution in this story telling
                that incorporates the power of music. Some characteristics of folk music are that the stories told
                often have a correlation with culture, as well as talk often about personal events in the songwriters
                life.  Folk also often forgoes complicated instrumentals in favor of letting the story and the power
                of what is being told shine through.
